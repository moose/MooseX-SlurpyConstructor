Revision history for MooseX-SlurpyConstructor

{{$NEXT}}

1.2     2011-04-12
        - Complete rewrite to resolve various issues (Karen Etheridge):
          - constructor is not inlined (RT#66784)
          - child classes cannot be slurpy if the parent is not (RT#66785)
          - compatibility issues with Moose 2.0
          - use from within a role
          - interactions with MooseX::StrictConstructor are now reversed -
            if Strict behaviour is applied to the class, it will take
            precedence over Slurpy behaviour. This is a simply due to how
            method modification works in Moose: the constructor cannot be
            "unmodified" again to tolerate arguments that it already finds
            intolerable.

1.1     2010-08-29
        - Previous versions didn't honour undefined predicates or lazy
          attributes
            - fixed, with tests to ensure no regression in future.
            - thanks to Christian Walde for report and fix.
            - I'm surprised I never ran into this issue before now. :)
        - Now avoids deprecation warnings about Moose::Util::MetaRole
            - thanks again to Christian Walde for report
        - Moved pod testing into xt dir
        - Upped required Moose version to 0.94.
        - Minor non-semantic changes.

0.94      2010-01-26
        - Fixed tests to:
            - remove tests about import to main package, as now allowed by
              Moose
            - test file for bad usage wasn't active, due to bad filename,
              fixed.
        - Changed versioning to be latest updated Moose version.
        - No main code changes.

0.11      2009-07-28
        - Avoid test failures when specific Test::* versions are used.
        - No main code changes.

0.10      2009-07-13
        - Honour 'slurpy' attributes 'init_arg' when determining if request is
          valid.
        - Underlying implementation now wraps 'new' instead of BUILDARGS, to
          allow slurpy attribute with no init_arg defined.
        - Better error messages.
        - Doesn't untar into the current directory when installing (oops, sorry!)

0.01      2009-07-06
        - Initial version.
